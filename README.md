This repo is for the Spring 23 APPM 4600 class. This repo contains a folder for Homeworks and Labs. The Labs are what we do in lab every Thursday. Each Lab will have a different folder within the Labs folder. The Homework folder will have the homeworks for the week. There will also be subfolders for each homework.

In labs we work in groups of two or three people.

Labs are every Thursday at 10:10 and due at midnight.
Homeworks are due every Friday at 5pm.
